ABOUT
================================================================================
libpts is a library for handling pointcloud files in the pts file format. This
format is for example used for the pointclouds created by robots at the
University of Osnabr√ºck.


PTS FILE FORMAT
================================================================================
The pts file format is designed to store pointclouds in a simple, human
readable way. Each point is stored as a couple of values in one line of the pts
file. One line contains at least three values, representing the x-, y- and
z-position of the point in a three-dimensional cartesian coordinate system. If
one line has six or more values, it is assumed that the last three values
represent color information as 8-bit vales in a rgb color space. Additional
information may be stored behind the first set of values. This additional data
can either be a remission value or both quality information for the set color
and a flag indicating if the color was propper set.

Example of a pts file containing values for position, accuracy, color validity
and color information:
